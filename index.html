  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p class="meta">Last updated: 2 February 2026</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the mobile game application
    "Khinkali Hunter" (the "App").
  </p>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The App can be used offline for core gameplay.</li>
    <li>Some features may require internet connection (for example, leaderboards or cloud features).</li>
    <li>We do not sell your personal information.</li>
    <li>When online features are used, some data may be processed by third-party services (see below).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
  <p>
    We do not ask you to provide personal information like your name, phone number, or precise location to play the App.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you contact us by email, we receive your email address and message content and use it only to respond to you.
  </p>

  <h3>Online Features and PlayFab</h3>
  <p>
    The App uses PlayFab to provide optional online functionality such as leaderboards and related services.
    When you use these features, PlayFab may process certain data needed to operate them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The data involved may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>App-generated player identifiers (for example, an anonymous ID or PlayFab player ID).</li>
    <li>Gameplay and progress data relevant to the online feature (for example, scores submitted to leaderboards).</li>
    <li>Device and technical information commonly required for online services (for example, device identifiers, IP address, app version, and diagnostics).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This data is used to provide and secure online features, prevent abuse, and maintain service performance.
  </p>

  <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
  <p>
    We share data only as necessary to operate the App's optional online features through PlayFab.
    We do not sell your information.
  </p>

  <h3>Retention</h3>
  <p>
    If online features are used, online-related data (for example, leaderboard entries) may be stored on PlayFab
    for as long as needed to provide those features, unless you request deletion where applicable and technically possible.
  </p>

  <h3>Your Choices</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You can use the App offline and avoid optional online features.</li>
    <li>If you do not want leaderboard or cloud-related processing, do not use the online features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
  <p>
    The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
    If you believe a child provided personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.
  </p>

  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>
    No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. We take reasonable measures to protect the information
    processed for the App, and rely on trusted providers for online features.
  </p>

  <h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be posted on this page with a new "Last updated" date.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your use of the Application is also governed by our
  <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a>.
